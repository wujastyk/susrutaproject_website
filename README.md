You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.  XXXYYYZZZ

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

It is one of the foundations of Ayurveda, the traditional medicine of South Asia.

Today, *The Compendium of Suśruta* is normally studied through printed editions from the twentieth century that were in turn based on about a dozen ninenteenth-century manuscripts. These printed editions are full of errors and difficulties.

In January 2007, the Nepal-German Manuscript Cataloguing Project announced the discovery of an ancient palm-leaf manuscript of *The* *Compendium* that is reliably datable to 878 CE, MS Kathmandu KL 699. The manuscript is part of the Kathmandu library of Kesar Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana (1892–1964), a former Prime Minister of Nepal, and has been added by UNESCO to the “Memory of the World” register.

This manuscript pushes our physical evidence for the *Compendium* back by a *millennium*. Study of this thousand-year-old manuscript reveals a much earlier stage of the work’s textual development. This evidence, together with that of two closely-related early manuscripts in the Nepalese National Archives, places our historical understanding of this Asian medical classic on a new foundation.

The background images on this website are from MS Kathmandu KL 699.

With the completion of this project in 2024, a complete digital diplomatic transcription of KL 699 has been published along with other project publications (see [Project Outputs](https://sushrutaproject.org/project-publications/)).

The evolving critical edition of the Nepalese version of the *Suśrutasaṃhitā* is available at the [Saktumiva website area for the Suśrutasṃhit](https://saktumiva.org/wiki/wujastyk/susrutasamhita/start)[ā](https://saktumiva.org/wiki/wujastyk/susrutasamhita/start). (A [backup server](https://206-12-96-209.cloud.computecanada.ca/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=wiki:susrutaproject:start) is also available.)
