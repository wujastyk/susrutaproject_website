Scholars of Sanskrit epics, *purāṇa*s and several other literary genres are well aware of the fact that the texts they study may not always conform to the rules of grammar laid out in the textbooks. Scholars have tried to identify and describe the particular variations they encounter and have proposed different, often genre-specific, labels to designate these “deviant” varieties of Sanskrit. Here one thinks of the “Epic Sanskrit” or the “Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit”, to name the two most prominent examples. Among many other things, these labels and descriptions can assist a philologist in identifying the cultural and historical milieu in which a particular text or text passage may have been written.

In the widely circulated version of the *Suśrutasaṃhitā* and, for that matter, in other classical compendia of Āyurveda too, these grammatical irregularities are virtually absent. What is more, this observation also holds good, by and large, for the Nepalese version of the *Suśrutasaṃhitā*, or, to be less categorical, for the sections we have studied so far. We find many examples of syntactic ambiguities, orthographic variations and, less often, archaic or scarcely attested choices of words and genders (some examples were gathered in Klebanov 2021, and more will be presented in a forthcoming article by Birch et al.). Still, the basic rules about word-formation, declension, conjugation, the composition of sentences etc., are observed with very little to no exception.

However, during one of our recent reading sessions of the Nepalese version of Ut.38, we came across two verses that present another structural feature that could be seen as a marker of a non-Classical variety of Sanskrit.
