A few weeks ago, our group turned to the study of [Ut.38](https://saktumiva.org/wiki/wujastyk/susrutasamhita/06-su.ut/provisional-edition_uttaratantra?upama_ver=gx01428ssp), the chapter dealing with the “Countermeasures against Disorders of the Female Reproductive System” *(Yonivyāpatoratiṣedha)*.

## Brief summary of the content

Chapter 38 of the *Uttaratantra* talks about various diseases of the female reproductive system and, in doing so, combines both aspects that go into a representation of diseases in āyurvedic literature: signs, symptoms and pathogenesis *(nidāna)*, on the one hand, and medical treatment *(cikitsā)*, on the other. In chapters of the *Uttaratantra*, these two aspects are sometime dealt with in two different chapters X-*vijñānīya* (see, e.g., Ut.7 *Dṛṣṭigatarogavijñānīya*) and X-*pratiṣedha* (see, e.g., Ut.17 *Dṛṣṭigatarogapratiṣedha*). There are, however, many examples where this distinction is not made.

## Textual Parallels

The current chapter is parallel in its content to *Aṣṭāṅgasaṃgraha* 6.38 and 6.39 as well as *Aṣṭāṅgahṛdayasaṃhitā* 6.33 and 6.34 (*Guhyarogavijñāna* and *Guhyarogapratiṣedha* respectively).

A close literary parallel to the first part of the chapter is found in *Mādhavanidāna* 62. In addition to the basic text, there are several valuable pointers made in the *Madhukośa*, an early commentary on the *Mādhavanidāna*. This part of the text was authored by Śrīkaṇṭhadatta, who was most like a direct student of Vijayarakṣita. The latter wrote the first part of the *Madhukośa*, up to chapter 32, and, what is more, can be dated to the second half of the eleventh to the first half of the twelfthg centuries (see <span class="zp-InText-zp-ID--2579494-I9B6C2MR--wp1080 zp-InText-Citation loading" rel="{ 'pages': '22-26', 'items': '{2579494:I9B6C2MR}', 'format': '%a% %d%, %p%', 'brackets': '', 'etal': '', 'separator': '', 'and': '' }"></span>).

Another most interesting parallel is found in *Carakasaṃhitā* 6(Ci).30.

## On the placement of the chapter

While in the vulgate (<span class="zp-InText-zp-ID--2579494-6TS78DTP--wp1080 zp-InText-Citation loading" rel="{ 'pages': 'np', 'items': '{2579494:6TS78DTP}', 'format': '%a% %d%, %p%', 'brackets': '', 'etal': '', 'separator': '', 'and': '' }"></span>) the current chapter is found at the end of the section on paediatrics (*Kumāratantra*, or *Kumārabhṛtya* as this section is styled in Kathmandu KL 699), in the Nepalese version, this is chapter 6.58, and it is chapter 23 of an entirely different section, namely, the *Kāyācikitsā* (general, non-invasive medicine).

Several things are noteworthy in this regard:

- In the placement of the vulgate, this chapter follows upon 6.37 *Grahotpatti* (6.35 in the Nepalese version), a chapter that talks about the origination of nine *graha*s ‘planetary deities’ that are responsible for all children’s diseases described in previous chapters of the *Kumāratantra*. In this way, the current chapter retains the general focus on the *kaumārabhṛtya* ‘child bearing’, but, at the same time, marks a change to a distinct, less mystical approach to the topic at hand (that could originate in a cultural milieu different from that of the preceding 11 chapters). Ḍalhaṇa explains how the chapter fits its context in the following way:

> It is appropriate that for the sake of treating the disorders of the female reproductive system *(yonivyāpat)*, the chapter called *Yonivyāpatpratiṣedha* ‘Countermeasures Against Disorders of the Female Reproductive System’ (SS.6.38) is taught immediately after the chapter called Grahotpatti ‘Origination of Planetary Deities’ (SS.6.37). It is because (1) there is an explicit mention of the word “*yoni*” in the statement “born in the *yoni* ‘womb’ of animal and human” (in SS.6.37.13bc) and because (2) the disorders of the female reproductive system are the causes for the inborn disorders of children.
> 
> <cite>Ḍalhaṇa on SS.6.38.1: *grahotpattyadhyāyanantaraṃ ‘tiryagyoniṃ mānuṣaṃ ca’ iti vacanena yoner nāmasaṃkīrtanāt kumārajanmavikārakāraṇatvāc ca, yonivyāpaccikitsitārthaṃ yonivyāpatpratiṣedhādhyāyārambho yujyate* \[…\]</cite>

- In the placement of the Nepalese version, *Yonivyāpatpratiṣedha* is preceded by 6.56 *Mūtrāghātapratiṣedha* (6.58 in <span class="zp-InText-zp-ID--2579494-6TS78DTP--wp1080 zp-InText-Citation loading" rel="{ 'pages': 'np', 'items': '{2579494:6TS78DTP}', 'format': '%a% %d%, %p%', 'brackets': '', 'etal': '', 'separator': '', 'and': '' }"></span>) and 6.57 *Mūtrakṛcchrapratiṣedha* (6.59 in <span class="zp-InText-zp-ID--2579494-6TS78DTP--wp1080 zp-InText-Citation loading" rel="{ 'pages': 'np', 'items': '{2579494:6TS78DTP}', 'format': '%a% %d%, %p%', 'brackets': '', 'etal': '', 'separator': '', 'and': '' }"></span>), two chapters dealing with the diseases of the urinary tract. The current chapter carries on with the topic of diseases that affect genitalia. In its Nepalese version, the chapter opens with two verses that explain the reasons for treating the particular set of diseases. These lack any reference to the inborn disorders of children *(kumārajanmavikāra)* mentioned by Ḍalhaṇa, and instead highlight the importance of curing female diseases for the satisfaction of male partner.

- SS.1.3 in both the vulgate and the Nepalese version lists the chapter at the place, where it is found in the vulgate.

> *naigameṣacikitsā ca grahotpattiḥ sayonijāḥ*
> 
> <cite>Sū.3.37ab</cite>

- Parallel chapters in the *Aṣṭāṅgasaṃgraha* and the *Aṣṭāṅgahṛdayasaṃhitā* form a part of the *Śalyatantra* section of each text.
