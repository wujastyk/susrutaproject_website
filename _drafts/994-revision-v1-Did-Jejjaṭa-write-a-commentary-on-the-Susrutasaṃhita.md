The scholar Jejjaṭa is known for his important, early commentary on the *Carakasaṃhitā*, entitled the *Nirantarapadavyākhyā* <span class="zp-InText-zp-ID--2579494-N9ANTLPZ--wp1010 zp-InText-Citation loading" rel="{ 'pages': 'IA191-194', 'items': '{2579494:N9ANTLPZ}', 'format': '(%a%, %d%, %p%)', 'brackets': '', 'etal': '', 'separator': '', 'and': '' }"></span>. He lived in the seventh or eighth century and his commentary is mainly known to us because it was frequently quoted by Cakrapāṇidatta, the most famous commentator whose full study of the *Carakasaṃhitā* survives. Jejjaṭa’s commentary on the *Carakasaṃhitā* survived to modern times unfortunately in only a single fragmentary manuscript. [This unique manuscript](https://www.panditproject.org/entity/108240/manuscript) was owned by the learned Keralan physician and book-collector [Uzhuttara Warrier](https://www.panditproject.org/entity/108257/person) (1855-1936, also known as Rudra Warrier and Rudrapāraśava). Uzhuttara’s personal library is now untraceable, but before it vanished a [list](https://www.panditproject.org/entity/108562/print) of it’s contents was made by Prof. V. Raghavan in about 1954, and the list confirms Uzhuttara’s manuscript of Jejjaṭa’s commentary. Before the library vanished, a handwritten copy of Uzhuttara’s manuscript was made in 1920 and deposited in the Government Oriental Manuscript Collection in Chennai ([MS Chennai GOML R 2983](https://www.panditproject.org/entity/108242/manuscript)). Scholarship on this work has been conducted in recent years by Zysk and Yamashita <span class="zp-InText-zp-ID--2579494-9VIZCN5T--wp1010 zp-InText-Citation loading" rel="{ 'pages': 'np', 'items': '{2579494:9VIZCN5T}', 'format': '(%a%, %d%, %p%)', 'brackets': '', 'etal': '', 'separator': '', 'and': '' }"></span>.

But did Jejjaṭa *also* write a commentary on the other great Ayurvedic classic, the *Suśrutasaṃhitā*?

## The evidence for a commentary on the Suśrutasaṃhitā

Meulenbeld stated the matter with complete conviction: “It is beyond all doubt that Jejjaṭa also wrote a commentary on the whole of the Suśrutasaṃhitā” (IA 192). His evidence consisted of the following points.

- Candraṭa said he consulted it before writing his *Suśrutapāṭhaśuddhi*. \[n. 393: In the commentary on the Cikitsākalikā: introduction, 161-162, 191-192, 221-222; in theSusrutapaṭhaśuddhi.\]
- Niścalakara cited it in his *Ratnaprabhā*.
- Ḍalhaṇa cited it in his *Nibandhasaṅgraha* at the start of his own commentary.
- Hemādri described it in his *Āyurvedarasāyana*. \[n. 396: Ad Ah.Su.l . l ; 2.11cd-12ab; 6.75cd-78, 99cd; 7.40-4 lab; 8.28.\]

There are two further pieces of evidence, both referenced by Meulenbeld in his notes:

- A manuscript in the Anup Sanskrit Library, Bikaner, [MS Bikaner Anup 4391](https://www.panditproject.org/entity/108211/manuscript), is catalogued as being this commentary.
- In footnote 1, D. C. Bhattacharyya asserted that this Jejjaṭa’s Suśruta commentary was often cited in the Rudrapāraśava’s 1913-1926 edition of the *Aṣṭāṅgasaṅgraha* <span class="zp-InText-zp-ID--2579494-V8FDW2ZP-_-2579494-FKK8UNFR--wp1010 zp-InText-Citation loading" rel="{ 'pages': '112--np', 'items': '{2579494:V8FDW2ZP},{2579494:FKK8UNFR}', 'format': '(%a%, %d%, %p%)', 'brackets': '', 'etal': '', 'separator': '', 'and': '' }"></span>.

On closer study, it appears that the last piece of evidence, at least, may be challenged.

## Further evidence

Ḍalhaṇa on Su.śā.2.48f. remarks that “these two ślokas are not read by Jejjhaṭa” (*imau dvāv api ślokau jejjhaṭācāryeṇa na paṭhitau* <span class="zp-InText-zp-ID--2579494-6TS78DTP--wp1010 zp-InText-Citation loading" rel="{ 'pages': '349', 'items': '{2579494:6TS78DTP}', 'format': '(%a%, %d%, %p%)', 'brackets': '', 'etal': '', 'separator': '', 'and': '' }"></span>).

Ḍalhaṇa also mentions Jejjaṭa (as Jejjhaṭa) in the following places: SS 1.13.3; 45.46, 48, 49, 126, 157, 178; 46.4, 13, 141-142, 262, 273, 313, 343, 371-372, 376, 422-431, 468-470; SS.2.1.52-58, 73; 2.14; 4.5; 5.8, 13; 13.3; SS.3.1.11; 2.48-49; 5.11.
