[Candraṭa](https://www.panditproject.org/entity/40937/person) was a Sanskrit author on medical topics who lived in the period 900-1050 CE (Meulenbeld HIML IIA, 122-125). He is perhaps best known for writing a commentary on his father Tīsaṭa’s treatise, *[Cikitsākalikā](https://www.panditproject.org/entity/42163/work)*. But Candraṭa wrote several other works, and of most relevance to our project is his “Editorial Corrections to the Suśruta text” (*[Suśrutapāṭhaśuddhi](https://www.panditproject.org/entity/108174/work)*). Candraṭa himself said that he wrote this work, in a verse included at the end of his commentary on the *Cikitsākalikā*:

> *cikitsākalikāṭīkāṃ yogaratnasamuccayam/  
> suśrute pāṭhaśuddhiṃ ca tritayaṃ candraṭo vyadhat//*
> 
>   
> “I created the following three works: the commentary on the *Cikitsākalikā*, the *Yogaratnasamuccaya* and the *Suśrutapāṭhaśuddhi* (`Correction of the Text of the Suśruta’).”
> 
> <cite>— MS Oxford Bodleian Library Fraser 21 (Aufrecht 1864: 358, entry no. 852), dated 1530 CE.</cite>

An authorial statement is also found in some colophons of the *Suśrutapāṭhaśuddhi* itself, as is shown on f. 59 of [MS London IOLR Taylor 1842](https://www.panditproject.org/entity/108178/manuscript) (Eggeling catalogue no. 2646):

> pāṭhaśuddhiḥ kṛtā taṃtre ṭīkām ālokya jaijjaṭīṃ //*
> 
> “The correction of readings (*pāṭhaśuddhi*) in the treatise of Suśruta was done by Candraṭa the son of the doctor Tīsaṭa, after studying the commentary of Jejjaṭa.”

Another MS that has the same statement is [MS Bikaner Anup 4391](https://panditproject.org/entity/108211/manuscript) (Kunhan Raja Catalogue p. 337):

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">![](https://sushrutaproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-4-1024x132.png)</figure>In an undated manuscript of the *Suśrutasaṃhitā*, śārīrasthāna, from Kurukṣetra, we find the same text in a section colophon, but in a slightly expanded form:

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">![](https://sushrutaproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1024x154.png)</figure>> *sūtrasthānaṃ nidānena śārīreṇa samanvitaṃ /  
> samāptaṃ vai turīyaṃ te vakṣyāmy atra cikitsitaṃ //  
> sauśrute caṃdraṭeneha bhiṣakṭīsaṭasūnunā /  
> pāṭhaśuddhiḥ kṛtā taṃtre ṭīkām ālokya jaijjaṭīṃ // ḥ // śrīḥ//*
> 
> “The sūtrasthāna has been completed, with the nidāna and śārīra sthānas, and I will explain the fourth, the cikitsāsthāna. The *Correction of Readings* (*pāṭhaśuddhi*) in the treatise of Suśruta was done by Candraṭa the son of the doctor Tīsaṭa, after studying the commentary of Jejjaṭa.”

The Kurukṣetra colophon above has the extra initial statement, “I will explain (*vakṣyāmi*).” It is not clear whose voice this is. Is it the scribe? But *vakṣyāmi* is normally an authorial expression, where a scribe would be more likely to say something like *likhyate mayā*. The second statement, which is the same as that of the London MS, is more straightforward: Candraṭa wrote *The Correction of Readings*. This sounds like a statement by Candraṭa himself. However, this raises the question of why the statement appears at the end of the Kurukṣetra manuscript, which contains only the *Suśrutasaṃhitā*, and does not include Candraṭa’s work. However, it is definitely of interest that the scribe of the Kurukṣetra manuscript was aware of Candraṭa’s work and thought of it as a relevant reference to raise in the context of a manuscript of the *Suśrutasaṃhitā*. This means that several centuries after Candraṭa, the *Suśrutasaṃhitā* was thought of as a work that he had corrected.
