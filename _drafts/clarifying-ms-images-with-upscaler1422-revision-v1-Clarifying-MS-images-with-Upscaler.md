A few days ago I became aware of the program [Upscaler](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2022/11/upscaler-open-source-ai-image-upscale-app-for-linux). This is, “a free, open source app that leverages the power of artificial intelligence to upscale image quality.” I tried it out on a fuzzy manuscript image from [MS Kathmandu NAK 1-1079](https://www.panditproject.org/entity/104941/manuscript), and I think the result is extremely promising.

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">![](https://sushrutaproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/1-1079-1024x572.png)<figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Original</figcaption></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large">![](https://sushrutaproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/1-1079-upscaler-1024x572.png)<figcaption class="wp-element-caption">After Upscaler</figcaption></figure>You may think that you can get this kind of result just by upping the contrast setting on your viewer. But what Upscaler does to the image becomes more apparent at greater magnifications:

<div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-143 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex"><div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow" style="flex-basis:100%"><div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-142 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex"><div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full">![](https://sushrutaproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/image.png)</figure></div><div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full">![](https://sushrutaproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/image-1.png)</figure></div></div></div></div>The processing is quite slow, but highly worthwhile on a folio-by-folio basis if one is reading carefully. The processed image gives you a sense of the scribe’s actual strokes.
