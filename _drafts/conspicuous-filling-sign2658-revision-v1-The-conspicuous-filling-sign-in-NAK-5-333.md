In one of the Nepalese manuscripts on which this project is based, the fifteenth-century Nepalese MS, [MS Kathmandu NAK 5-333](https://www.panditproject.org/entity/102310/manuscript), there are mysterious characters at a few places. They are the two similar characters in the centre of this image:

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large">![](https://sushrutaproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/oo1.png)</figure></div>and again

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large">![](https://sushrutaproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/oo2.png)</figure></div>Here, the surrounding word is pāke  
These symbols are not letters, since they don’t contribute to the surrounding text, but interrupt it. I have wondered whether they are the scribe expressing that his archetype has a string-hole at this place, perhaps, but I don’t see the symbols often enough for that. They occur rather rarely.
