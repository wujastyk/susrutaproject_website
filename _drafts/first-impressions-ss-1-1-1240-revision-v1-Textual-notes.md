## SS.1.1.0

The opening scribal invocation of KL 699 dedicates the work to *Kamalahasta* “him with the lotus hands.” This is an honorific title used for the Buddhist Padmapāṇi or [Avalokiteśvara.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalokite%C5%9Bvara)

## SS.1.1.1 

MSS K, H and N read the ungrammaticl ādhyāyam. This suggests either an spelling error in the early transmission or the omission of “nām” (yielding “nāmādhyāyam”).

## SS.1.1.2

The expression “yathovāca bhagavān dhanvantariḥ||2||” “As Reverend Dhanvantari said,” is present in the Ācārya 1931 vulgate and most printed editions but is absent in MSS K, N and H. This is important for the history of the text, since it removes a layer of divine narration from the work.

## SS.1.1.3

The reading of MS K may be translated:

> Now, then, Aupadhenava, Vaitaraṇa, Aurabhra, Puṣkalāvata, Karavīra, Gopurarakṣita, Bhoja, Suśruta and others addressed Reverend Divodāsa, king of Kāśī, the best of the immortals, surrounded by groups of sages, who was in his ashram.

- In MS K, A manus secundus has added “dhanvantari” faintly in the margin above “divvodāsam aupa\[dhenava\]”:

This reading with “dhanvantarim” is normal in the vulgate editions. This is a second case where the early Nepalese MSS remove Dhanvantari from the narrative frame.

- The list of speakers includes [Bhoja](https://www.panditproject.org/entity/108652/person), a pre-500 CE author of a *Bhojasaṃhitā* (see HIML IA, 690-691). Bhoja is omitted from the vulgate editions.
