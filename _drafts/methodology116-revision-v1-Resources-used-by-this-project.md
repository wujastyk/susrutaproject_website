- [SAKTUMIVA](http://saktumiva.org) by Charles Li. A platform for producing and publishing critical editions of Sanskrit texts. “[Reconstructing a Sanskrit text](https://chchch.github.io/sanskrit-alignment/docs/index.html)“: documentation of the alignment, collation and stemmatic methods in Saktumiva.
- [The Nepal-German Manuscript Preservation Project](https://www.istb.univie.ac.at/caraka/) (1970-2002; the “NGMPP”).
- [The Nepal-German Manuscript Cataloguing Project](https://www.aai.uni-hamburg.de/en/forschung/ngmcp) (2002-2014; the “NGMCP”).
- [Quick Palaeographer ](https://chchch.github.io/quick-palaeographer/)by Charles Li. A browser-based tool for reading MS images and developing a catalogue of character shapes.
- [PanditProject](http://panditproject.org), a prosopographical database of early Indic scholars, works and manuscripts.
- The digital [New Catalogus Catalogorum](https://vmlt.in/ncc), a survey of works and authors in the Sanskrit and Prakrit languages. Begun at the University of Madras in 1949 by Prof. V. Raghavan and currently nearing completion in 42 published volumes under the direction of Prof. Siniruddha Dash. Now available both in print and digitally.
- [Philosophy and Medicine in Early Classical India](https://www.istb.univie.ac.at/caraka/) (the Vienna “Caraka Project”).
- Searchable [etext of the Suśrutasaṃhitā with Ḍalhaṇa’s commentary](https://niimh.nic.in/ebooks/esushruta/index.php) at the Natonal Center of Indian Medical Heritage, Hyderabad
- [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) is used for document preparation.

## Tools and projects not currently selected

The Sushruta Project team have evaluated many software solutions for use in this project. The following is a list of the most technically relevant that we have evaluated positively but decided against at the present time.

- [Transkribus](https://readcoop.eu/transkribus/), a platform for the transcription and searching of historical documents. Transkribus is a mature program that offers useful features for the diplomatic transcription of manuscripts. In some contexts it may help a project like ours to provide a standardized interface for a team of MS transcribers.
- [T-Pen](http://t-pen.org/TPEN/), provides similar functionality to Transkribus: a team of inputters could use a convenient interface to transcript MSS diplomatically.
- [Edition Visualization Technology](http://evt.labcd.unipi.it/) is “a tool specifically designed to create digital editions from XML-encoded texts.” EVT reads a TEI-encoded critical edition (using parallel segmentation) and displays it with several useful add-on features. It can handle hot-linking between text and manuscript image. There is a [demo available of the text of Avicenna’s Logica](http://evt.labcd.unipi.it/demo/evt2-beta2/avicenna/index.html#/readingTxt?d=doc_1&p=C-112v&s=text-body-div&e=critical).
- [Textual Communities](https://textualcommunities.org/app/community/?id=5ae4492bb6bf889b25d8418f&route=view&document=5d437ea2e01ff5326602c0de&page=5d437e5b1d393e0000ee31b6), by Peter Robinson (University of Saskatchewan). Textual Communities offers a rich environment and toolset for transcribing and collating manuscripts and producing digital editions of pre-modern texts. In many ways it is similar to Saktumiva. But Textual Communities is more focussed on European-language sources and does not provide the specific Sanskrit-language features of Saktumiva. However, Textual Communities has social-network aspects that are important and it could certainly be used for an Indic-language project.
- [Ekdosis](https://ctan.org/pkg/ekdosis?lang=en), a LaTeX macro package for typesetting critical editions, similar in purpose to [EDMAC](https://github.com/wujastyk/edmac) (and derivatives). Ekdosis offers a rigorous syntax for manually entering one’s text and critical apparatus. But a benefit of this syntax is that output can be as a typeset PDF or as TEI XML with the apparatus expressed as parallel segmentation.
