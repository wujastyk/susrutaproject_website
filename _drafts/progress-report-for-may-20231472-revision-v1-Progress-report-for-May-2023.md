I am very pleased to announce that today that project members have completed the transcription of the Nidānasthāna from MS NAK 1-1079. That means we have transcribed all the evidence we have from manuscripts K, N, and H for the Nidānasthāna.

The transcribing situation now is as follows:

1. sūtrasthāna – nearly done
2. nidānasthāna – completed
3. śārīrasthāna – completed
4. cikitsāsthāna – completed
5. kalpasthāna – completed
6. uttaratantra – completed

Well done everyone!

Full details by adhyāya can be seen in the document “[Adhyāya transcriptions completed](https://github.com/wujastyk/sushrutaproject/blob/main/docs/Adhy%C4%81ya%20transcriptions%20completed.md).”

The transcriptions themselves can be viewed[ on GitHub](https://github.com/wujastyk/sushrutaproject), and of course the collations and editions are at [Saktumiva](https://saktumiva.org/wiki/wujastyk/susrutasamhita/start).
