- [*Suśrutasaṃhitā*](https://www.panditproject.org/entity/42004/work)  
    The beginnings of a list of known MSS of this work. Also, links to information about the earliest commentaries on the work.
- The [*Suśrutapāṭhaśuddhi*](https://www.panditproject.org/entity/108174/work) of Candraṭa  
    A little-explored early work of textual criticism focussed on the Suśruta text that may have strongly influenced the post-Nepalese transmission.
- [A possible manuscript of the lost commentary by Jejjaṭa](https://www.panditproject.org/entity/108209/work).   
    Jejjaṭa is known for his early commentaries on the Carakasaṃhitā, parts of which have survived in south India. It is less well known that he authored a commentary on the *Suśrutasaṃhitā*, although this is probably lost.
- The [*Nyāyacandrikā*](https://www.panditproject.org/entity/108025/work) of Gayadāsa, an important and very early commentary (including a previously unknown MS in Bikaner)
