The [PanditProject](http://panditproject.org) is a leading prosopographical resource in classical Indian studies. as its method of recording and referrring to information about South Asian intellectual history. The project is headed by Professor [Yigal Bronner](http://yigalbronner.huji.ac.il/) at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. PanditProject records biographical information about persons, their works and the manuscripts that transmit those works in a network of linked relationships. The PanditProject has been adopted as the principle prosopographical and literary reference resource for the Sushruta Project.

## Starting points relevant to this project

[*Suśrutasaṃhitā*](https://www.panditproject.org/entity/42004/work)  
A list of all known manuscripts of the work (still growing). Also, links to information about the earliest commentaries on the work.

The [*Suśrutapāṭhaśuddhi*](https://www.panditproject.org/entity/108174/work) of Candraṭa  
A little-explored early work of textual criticism focussed on the Suśruta text that may have strongly influenced the post-Nepalese transmission.

A possible manuscript of the lost [commentary by Jejjaṭa](https://www.panditproject.org/entity/108209/work)  
[Jejjaṭa](https://www.panditproject.org/entity/40830/person) is known for his early commentary on the *Carakasaṃhitā*, parts of which have survived in south India. It is less well known that he may have authored a commentary on the *Suśrutasaṃhitā*, although this may be almost completely lost. It was reported by D. C. Bhattacharya (1947) that the edition of the *Aṣṭāṅgasaṃgraha* by Rudrapāraśara contained citations from this commentary \[[note](https://www.panditproject.org/entity/108209/work)\]. Recent information has cast more doubt on the survival of this commentary (2021, Madhu K. Paramesvaran, personal communication). However, the 1944 catalogue of the Anup Sanskrit library (p.337) records that [this manuscript](https://www.panditproject.org/entity/108211/manuscript) contains an Uttaratantra.” Since only the *Suśrutasaṃhitā* has such a section, the identity of the text in this manuscript may indeed be a commentary on the *Suśrutasaṃhitā*. The issue cannot be settled without inspection of the manuscript. Unfortunately, the owners of the Anup library do not allow manuscripts to be studied by scholars.

The [*Nyāyacandrikā*](https://www.panditproject.org/entity/108025/work) of Gayadāsa, an important and very early commentary (including a previously unknown MS in Bikaner)
