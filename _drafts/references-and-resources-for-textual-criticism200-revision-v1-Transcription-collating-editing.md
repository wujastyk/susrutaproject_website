The following are the main sources that have informed our theoretical stance towards the tasks of this project.

## Critical references and resources

- [Guidelines for Editors of Scholarly Editions](https://www.mla.org/Resources/Research/Surveys-Reports-and-Other-Documents/Publishing-and-Scholarship/Reports-from-the-MLA-Committee-on-Scholarly-Editions/Guidelines-for-Editors-of-Scholarly-Editions), Modern Languages Association (2011). Includes an important annotated bibliography on digital methods in textual criticism.
- [MLA Statement on the Scholarly Edition in the Digital Age](https://www.mla.org/content/download/52050/1810116/rptCSE16.pdf) (2016)  
    The above two sources locate the present project in the history and theory of digital scholarly editions as they have evolved since the 1980s.
- The [Text Encoding Initiative Guidelines on the transcription of primary sources](https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/PH.html)  
    A critical adjunct to the above MLA sources, since the present digital edition rests on the transcription of manuscripts using the TEI guidelines. (A [gentle introduction](http://prakrit.info/dh/index.html) for Sanskritists.)
- [SARIT Encoding Guidelines](https://sarit.indology.info/sarit-pm/docs/encoding-guidelines-simple.html) for the TEI encoding of Sanskrit texts by Liudmila Olalde, Andrew Ollett, and Patrick McAllister (short version). ([Full version](https://sarit.indology.info/sarit-pm/docs/encoding-guidelines-full.html).)
- [Reconstructing a Sanskrit text](https://chchch.github.io/sanskrit-alignment/docs/index.html) by Charles Li.   
    Documentation of the alignment, collation and stemmatic methods in Saktumiva.

    Covers some of the same ground as the SARIT Encoding Guidelines above. Extremely detailed and aimed more at epigraphical sources than manuscripts.
