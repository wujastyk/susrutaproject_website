The discussion on “Flora and Fauna of India” at INDOLOGY ([May 2021](https://list.indology.info/pipermail/indology/2021-May/054633.html)) led to the mention of several useful resources for identifying plants in early Indian literature. (It has long been inadequate to cite Monier-Williams.) Some of these resources have been in print for many years, others are more recent. But the links below make the search for identifications somewhat more convenient.

- [Meulenbeld Sanskrit Names of Plants](https://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/SNPScan/2020/web/index.php)
- [eNighaṇṭu from AYUSH](https://niimh.nic.in/ebooks/e-Nighantu/)
- [Pandanus database](http://iu.ff.cuni.cz/pandanus/)

A useful key to resources for modern binomial plant names and taxonomies (that are subject to change and revision):

- [World Flora Online](https://www.worldfloraonline.org) (formerly <http://www.theplantlist.org/>)
- [International Plant Names Index](https://www.ipni.org/)
- [Annotated Checklist of the Flowering Plants of Nepal](http://www.efloras.org/flora_page.aspx?flora_id=110)
- The [Biodiversity Heritage Library](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/) is an extraordinarily rich collection of indexed and scanned botanical research books from the fifteenth century onwards. See, for example, this beautiful illustration from the [Hortus Malabaricus, vol. 1](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/14375#page/21/mode/1up) (Amsterdam, 1678).
