## **Introduction**

This paper represents a preliminary edition and translation of *Suśruta Saṃhitā Cikitsāsthana* 26. The verses in the chapter are composed in anuṣṭubh metre and deal with potency-therapy (*vyājīkaraṇa*). In comparison with the vulgate edition (A), K covers verses 1 through the beginning of 27, of which only the first five *akṣara*s are found. The remainder of verse 27 through verse 39 is wanting. The abruptly truncated verse indicates that the chapter originally contained more text. Of verses 1-27 of A, K has a total of 22 verses, leaving the following to be found only in A: 2, 6, 8-9cd, 13cd, 14, and 16ab. The 22 verses make a unique version of the chapter 26. K’s readings show characteristics that are also found in Mahāyāna Buddhist manuscripts from Nepal, such as sibilant and gender fluidity. The readings in A are sometimes mere metrical variations of K and overall represent embellishments and alternate interpretation of K that have occurred over time.

**Text, translation, and notes**

> 
> Now we shall discuss the treatment by means of potency-therapy for him whose strength is diminished.

**Discussion**

Ḍ: *kṣīṇatā* is powerlessness (*hīnaśaktitvam*).

**Discussion**

Wanting in K.

> *kalyasyo\] kalasyo- K; aharahaḥ\] aharahar* A
> 
> For him who is healthy, whose age is advanced and who resorts to potency-therapy, daily coitus in all seasons is not prohibited.

**Discussion**

In a, K reads *kalasya*, “for him who soft/weak,” which could be possible. However, Ḍ reads *kalyasya* and glosses it as “without disease” (*rogarahitasya*). He glosses *udagravayasaḥ*, “whose age is advanced,” as “young” (*taruṇasya*). It would appear that Ḍ has in mind a very young adolescent, whereas the mūla-text indicates that the man is old.

> Potency-therapy formulae are suitable for the \[following men\]: …those who go with wild animals; who are old, who are lustful; those who are impotent; those who have little semen; those who are diminished in front of women; those who are sportive/wanton; those who are wealthy, handsome, and youthful; and those who have many wives.

**Discussion**

For verse 3, A reads much clearer: “who are old, lustful, desirous of women’s favour, diminished on account of their indulgence in women, impotent, and men with little semen….” For 3ab, it would appear that K is a corruption of another reading altogether. K’s *akṣaryāṃ* is doubtful. It appears to be a feminine genitive plural from the stem *akṣarī*/*i*, which is not found in the lexicons. A replaces *akṣaryāṃ mṛgayatāṃ* with *vāllabhyam icchatām*, “desirous of women’s favour.” The reading *riraṃsatām* appears to be an unattested present participle form from the desiderative stem of the √*ram*, “to be or make content,” i.e. lusting after, lustful. The attested form is found in A.

---

> *sevamāno yadaucityād vājīvātyarthavegavān/*
> 
> *nārīs tarpayate tena vājīkaraṇam ucyate*// A 6
> 
> Potency therapy is called that by which a man, when he habitually uses it, and being possessed of excessive impetuosity like a stallion, satisfies women.

**Discussion**

This verse is only found in A, and appears to be a later definition of potency-therapy. Ḍ states that it is a definition of potency-therapy and quotes this unidentified half śloka: *vājīvātibalo yena yāty apratihataḥ striyaḥ*, “whereby, he, excessively strong like a stallion, goes, unrestrained, to women.”

> 
> *-srotro ’nugāminyas\] -śrotrānugāminyas A; tvaksukhasparśanāni ca\] tvacaḥ sparśanās tathā* A.
> 
> Various kinds of foods and drinks, hearing the voice of a female companion, and soft touches on the skin,

**Discussion**

K’s *s* for *ś* is indicative of Prakrit and vernacular readings or Newari scribal practices. The variations found in A tend to take the form of rephrasing of pādas rather than one word replacements. This is indicative of emendation. K’s reading of pāda d is more explicit.

---

> *gītaṃ śrotramanohāri tāmbūlaṃ madirāḥ srajaḥ*// A 8
> 
> the night with a tilaka-like moon (i.e., a full moon), an amorous and fresh young woman, song that is charming to the ear, betal, wine/alcohol, garlands,

**Discussion**

This verse occurs only in A and extends the list of sexually arousing items, indicative of Kāmaśāstra literature.

> 
> But, in the case of a lustful man’s mind that is impaired by various unpleasant states, men’s impotency occurs when the flag (i.e., penis) falls down.

**Discussion**

K seems to have a complete verse, but A has something different in cd: “and because of sex with despicable women, impotency is considered to be mental.” A inserts two pādas that move the topic from impotency as a problem of non-arousal to impotency as a psychological problem.

---

> *annair amloṣṇalavaṇair atimātropasevitaiḥ/*  
> *saumyadhātukṣayo dṛṣṭaḥ klaivyaṃ tad aparaṃ smṛtaṃ*// 8 A 10cd-11ab
>

> 
> Another kind of impotency is known when there is observed a diminished cool dhātu (= semen) because of sour, hot, and salty foods used in excess.

**Discussion**

In a, in place of *annair amloṣṇa*– in K, A has *kaṭukālmoṣṇa*-, “pungent, sour, hot.”

---

> *ativyavāyaśīto vā na ca vyājīkriyārataḥ/*  
> *dvajabhaṅgam avāpnoti sa śukhrakṣayahetukam*// 9 A 11cd-12ab
> 
> *sa śukhra-\] tac chukra-* A
> 
> He, who indulges in excessive coitus and does not have recourse to potency-therapy, suffers decay/frustration of the penis because of the loss of semen.

**Discussion**

A’s reading in d is based on metre.

---

> *meḍhrarogeṇa mahatā marmacchedena vā punaḥ/*  
> *klaivyaṃ caturthaṃ bhavati nṛṇāṃ puṃstvopaghātājam*// 10 A 12cd-13ab

> 
> Moreover, a fourth type of impotency that destroys men’s masculinity is caused by severe disease of the penis or by a cut at the marman-point.

**Discussion**

A’s readings are based on metre.

---

> *janman prabhṛti yaḥ klībaḥ klaibyaṃ tat sahajaṃ smṛtam // A 13cd*  
> *balinaḥ kṣubdhamanaso nirodhād brahmacaryataḥ/*  
> *ṣaṣṭaṃ klaibyaṃ mataṃ tat tu kharaśukranimittajam*// A 14
> 
> *khara-\] sthira-* A (Pā).
> 
> Impotency that begins at birth is known as congenital impotency. The sixth type of impotency, originating from harsh (old) semen, is believed to be caused by a strong man’s disturbed mind, suppression \[of the natural urges\], and celibacy.

**Discussion**

Ḍ glosses *balinaḥ*, lit. “of a strong man;” as *atisthūlasy*a, “of an excessively big (or clumsy) man;” *kṣubdhamanasaḥ*, “whose mind is disturbed,” as *calacittasya*, “whose mind is unsteady;” *nirodhāt*, “because of suppression \[of the natural urges\],” as *nirodhāt*(*d*) *vātamūtrādīnām*, because of suppression of wind and urine, etc;” and he reads *kharaṃ*(Pā: *sthiram*), “pungent/harsh (old) as *kaṭhinam*, “hard/stiff/harsh,” while others read *paruṣam*, “hard, stiff”.

These two types of impotency are found only in A and could well be supplementary information.

---

> *asādhyaṃ sahajaṃ klaivyaṃ marmacchedāc ca yad bhavet/*  
> *sādhyānām avaśiṣṭānāṃ kāryo vyājīkaro vidhiḥ*// 11 A 15
> 
> *avaśiṣṭānāṃ\] itareṣāṃ tu A; vyājīkaro vidhiḥ\] hetuviparyayaḥ* A
> 
> Both congenital impotency and \[impotency\] caused by a cut at the *marman*-point are incurable; for the remaining curable \[types of impotency\], a formula of potency-therapy should be used.

**Comment**

In c, A’s variant appears to be based on metre; in d, it provides a different meaning: *hetuviparyayaḥ*, “\[a remedy\] contrary to the cause,” which implies an allopathic approach to healing.

---

> *vidhir vājīkaro yas tu taṃ pravakṣyāmy ataḥ param*/ A 16ab
> 
> Hence, I shall describe the other type of potency-therapy formula.

**Comment**

This half-verse, found only in A, appears to result from a corrupt reading of the previous pāda in K (11d).

---

> *rasair ikṣurasair vāpi maditaṃ saindhavānvitam// 13 A 16cd-17ab*  
> *varāhamedasā yuktāṃ ghṛtenotkārikāṃ pacet/*

> 
> One should cook in ghee a *utkārikā*-cake \[made from\] the powder of sesame seeds, *māṣa*-beans, *vidārī*, and *śāli*-rice kneaded with \[meat\] soups or the juices of sugar cane, with the addition of *saindhava*-salt and combined with boar-fat. After eating it, men could go to sixty women.

**Comment**

For 13c, A has *pauṇḍrekṣurasair ārdraṃ*, “moistened with the juice of *pauṇḍra*-sugar cane.” Interestingly, Ḍ reads *rasair* in 13c and glosses it as *māṃsarasaiḥ*, “meat soup.” Moreover, he understands the *samāsa* to be a *dandva*: *ikṣurasaiś ca*, “and with the juice of sugar cane,” precisely following K. He glosses *utkārikām* as *lapsikām*, “a kind of prepared food.” For 14cd, A has something different: *puruṣo gacchet tu pramadāśatam*, “a man could go to 100 women.” First, it puts the sentence in the singular number, and secondly, it increases the potency by increasing the number of women, both of which point to a perhaps later interpretation.

> *śiśumāravasāpakvāḥ tais tilaiḥ śaṣkulīśubhān/*

> 
> If a man should eat delightful *śaṣkulī*-cakes, whose sesame seeds have been repeatedly steeped/soaked in milk boiled with goats’ testicles or cooked with porpoises’ fat, he \[then\] goes to 100 women \[each\] as if his first.

**Comment**

A has a slightly different reading in pāda d, without changing the meaning. Ḍ states that two formulae are indicated: one with goats’ testicles and the other with the fat of porpoises. Each has milk as the *anupāna* or after drink.

---

> *pippalīlavaṇopetau vastāṇḍau kṣīrasarpisi/*  
> *sādhitau bhakṣayed yas tu sa gacchet pramadāśatam// 16 A 20*
> 
> *lavaṇopetau\] lavaṇaupetau K \[CK Mss\], lavaṇopete D; vastāṇḍau\] vastāṇḍe A; sādhitau\] sādhite A.*
> 
> He, who should eat two goat’s testicles cooked in ghee and butter, with \[a little\] *pippalī*-pepper and salt added, could go to 100 women.

**Comment**

In a,b, and c, K has masculine dual, while A has neuter dual endings. The word *aṇḍa* is normally in neuter gender, but in K it is understood to be masculine (a characteristic of Buddhist Sanskit). Ḍ explains that butter is made from milk, the small (*kaścit*) amount of *pippalī*-pepper and salt is added, and the after drink (*anupāna*) is cold water (*śītalajalam*).

A man who eats and then drinks \[Ḍ as an *anupāna*, boiled\] milk sweetened with sugar, goes like *caṭaka*-bird/sparrow ten times for coitus without interruption.

> 
> After licking well-ground powder of *vidārī*, steeped in its own juice and combined with ghee and honey, a man mounts ten women.

**Comment**

In d, K and A (var. Pā) are based on the same reading. Ḍ explains that the milk is the *anupāna*, which is not indicated in the text.

---

> *evam āmalakaṃ cūrṇaṃ svarasenaiva bhāvitam/*  
> *śarkarāmadhusarpirbhir yuktaṃ līḍhvā payaḥ pibet/*

> 
> In the same way, after licking *āmalaka* (emblic myrobalan) steeped in its own juice with the addition of sugar, honey, and ghee, \[a man\] should drink milk (Ḍ as *anupāna*). By means of this formula, even a man of eighty years becomes excited like a young boy.

> 
> A man should eat the two testicles of a goat or a porpoise’s/ crocodile’s eggs prepared /fried in ghee and combined/seasoned with *pippalī*-pepper and salt. The two are powerful potency therapies.

**Comment**

K again takes *aṇḍa* in the masculine gender. In c, the word *śiśumāra* can mean either a porpoise or a crocodile. Since the testicles of a porpoise are not obvious, it probably refers to the eggs (*aṇḍa*) of a crocodile.

> 
> In the same way, he should eat the eggs of crabs (i.e., roe), tortoises, and crocodiles; or he should drink the semen of buffaloes, bulls, and goats.

**Comment**

Part of c and all of d are wanting in K. Ḍ explains that for *kulīra*, others read *gṛhacaṭaka* (var. Pā *gramacaṭaka*), “domestic sparrow;” *nakra*, “crocodile,” is a kind of fish (*matsyabheda*), colloquially known as *ghaḍiyāl*. He goes on to say that *aṇḍa*, “egg,” is a round support of life (*prāṇādhāro vartulaḥ*), but not a little testicle (*muṣkaḥ*); and because of the guru’s instruction the *aṇḍāni* are the testicles along with the scrotum (*tadādhārabhūtāny evāṇḍāni*). The eggs of roe of crabs are often served as a salty garnish in Asian cuisines.
