Today we completed the transcription of MS Kathmandu KL 699’s text of the *Suśrutasaṃhitā*!

There is more to do – always. We have the *Sauśrutanighaṇṭu* yet to do, but that is not very long compared to the text of the main work. Work on the transcription of MSS NAK 5-333 and 1-1079 is well-advanced. And there’s always proof-reading and double-checking everything. But today, we can celebrate a little.

For the technically-minded, I have updated all the files at Github and put out Release 2.0 of the files. This is also reflected at the Zenodo repository, [DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/305195084).

Congratulations and thanks to everyone who has worked on this over the last two years: Madhusudana, Deepro, Jane, Vandana, Harshal, Devayani, Gauri, Paras, Jason, and Andrey.
