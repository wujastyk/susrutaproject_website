Vitus Angermeier, a [project associate](https://sushrutaproject.org/project-associates/), has recently published a blog post on his own project website that explores the Nepalese version’s variant readings on the topic of epidemic disease. It is entitled, “Epidemics in Suśruta or: Why critical editions matter. An example from Ayurveda, Suśrutasaṃhitā.” See the whole post at <https://epidemics.univie.ac.at/epidemics-in-susruta/> and the related conference slides at <https://doi.org/10.17613/3ee7-rx05>.
