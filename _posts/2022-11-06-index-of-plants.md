In our translation of selected chapters of the *Suśrutasaṃhitā* we are doing a lot of work on the names of Sanskrit plants. We want to present this simply for the reader, using common English plant names. But at the same time we want to make some of the complexity of our referencing and decison-making available in a glossary at the back of the book. For this, I have made use the Glossaries package written by Nicola Talbot. My macros for doing this and some examples of how it works can be read in my [blog post at Cikitsā](https://cikitsa.blogspot.com/2022/11/making-index-of-plant-names.html).
