In a post yesterday, the developer of ChrysoCollate announced an upgrade to the free collation program ChrysoCollate. This is an interesting alternative to Saktumiva, though it has none of the special Indological features that make Saktumiva so powerful and still the first choice for collating and editing Indian manuscripts. Note specifically that ChrysoCollate requires you to manually add the text of witness after the first. There are other points too that make it best for other types of working than the Suśruta Project.

> I am pleased to announce the release of the new version 1.2 of ChrysoCollate.
> 
> New features:
> 
> - Apparatus entries layout: multiple lines (now default) or single lines
> - Improvement of the mouse wheel management (hold the shift button to change the axis)
> - Possibility to switch from negative apparatus to positive apparatus for particular variant locations only
> - Sensitive or not to: punctuation, u/v, i/j, ae/e, ti/ci
> - In addition to lacunae ({lacuna} tag), it is now possible to notify absent readings (using the {absentia} tag) and automatically write them in the apparatus criticus and in the *traditio textus*
> - Various discrete improvements and various bugs fixed (including the non-zero synchronisation point in the translation)
>
