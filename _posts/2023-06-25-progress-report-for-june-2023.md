I am pleased to report that a major project milestone has been reached. Last week we completed the transcription of all three Nepalese manuscripts of the *Suśrutasaṃhitā* that form the basis of our project.

All files have been uploaded to GitHub, and a “version release” of the files has been issued, version 3.0. This has also triggered the automatic deposit of the version 3.0 files [at Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8074059).

Full details by adhyāya can be seen in the document “[Adhyāya transcriptions completed](https://github.com/wujastyk/sushrutaproject/blob/main/docs/Adhy%C4%81ya%20transcriptions%20completed.md).”

The transcriptions themselves can be viewed[ on GitHub](https://github.com/wujastyk/sushrutaproject), and of course the collations and editions are at [Saktumiva](https://saktumiva.org/wiki/wujastyk/susrutasamhita/start).

## What is next?

We are moving now to editing, proof-reading and translation. The current translation file can be [viewed at GitHub](https://github.com/wujastyk/sushrutaproject/blob/main/translation/incremental_SS_Translation.pdf). It is an evolving draft document. The work specifically on the MS transcriptions includes checking word-spacing and checking the critical apparatus for integrity and accuracy.

The current project does not include funding for the transcription and editing of the *Sauśrutanighaṇṭu*, the index-dictionary of plant names. The text appears as part of MSS Nepal NAK 5-333, 1-1079, 1146 and KL 699 and was edited by K. S. Suvedī and N. Tīvārī and published in 2000.

## Publication in press

Another exciting moment for the project is the publication of our first monograph, *On the Plastic Surgery of the Ears and Nose: The Nepalese Version of the Suśrutasaṃhitā*. The book has been [announced on the publisher’s website](https://hasp.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/catalog/preview?lang=en), and it is scheduled to appear this summer, perhaps as early as next month, July 2023.
